<h1>USER RESEARCH</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    For user research i learned what the mission is for Department of Labor 
    and what services they provide. The Department of Labor improves working conditions 
    for wage earners and helps to make sure that their rights in the workplace are met. 
    The department of labor provides resources to users from forms that can be completed 
    online or printed, to access to agencies that ensure the needs and benefits of workers 
    are met at their places of employment. I also looked into what are some of the most 
    important aspects of the department of labor when it comes to the people who would most 
    frequent the site, the workers. Information to things like the family leave and medical
    act, fair labor standards, maternity leave, and unemployment insurance were some of the 
    ,most needed categories in which assistance was needed with the department of labor 
    having the necessary information for those seeking it.

  Looking at the site I felt a number of improvements could be made in terms of it being more 
  approachable. For example image collage takes up a lot of space and doesn't do much in conveying
   the sites purpose. It’s about workers but could be anyone without making it clear occupations and 
   It also takes up a lot of space. The drop down menus also don’t make it clear that things like topics 
   are a separate link

  <h3>Persona</h3>
  <p>
    I created the persona Helen to think of how the approach to sites navigation would be for an average user. Helen is a new parent that needs rest at home but is worried because she and her partner can't afford to miss hours at work. The DOL website could give her the needed information to resources like FMLA (The Family and Medical Leave Act) to help resolve the issue of missing work and alleviate Helen of the stress of financial complications.

  <p>
    Keeping in mind how Helen would interact with he DOL website to navigation, I performed some user test to learn what people thought of the site, its ease of use, and what issues could come up when navigating for specific information.
