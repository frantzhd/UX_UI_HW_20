<h1>USER RESEARCH</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    For user research i learned what the mission is for Department of Labor 
    and what services they provide. The Department of Labor improves working conditions 
    for wage earners and helps to make sure that their rights in the workplace are met. 
    The department of labor provides resources to users from forms that can be completed 
    online or printed, to access to agencies that ensure the needs and benefits of workers 
    are met at their places of employment. I also looked into what are some of the most 
    important aspects of the department of labor when it comes to the people who would most 
    frequent the site, the workers. Information to things like the family leave and medical
    act, fair labor standards, maternity leave, and unemployment insurance were some of the 
    ,most needed categories in which assistance was needed with the department of labor 
    having the necessary information for those seeking it.

  Looking at the site I felt a number of improvements could be made in terms of it being more 
  approachable. For example image collage takes up a lot of space and doesn't do much in conveying
   the sites purpose. It’s about workers but could be anyone without making it clear occupations and 
   It also takes up a lot of space. The drop down menus also don’t make it clear that things like topics 
   are a separate link

  <!--<h3>Persona</h3>-->
  <p>
    I created the persona Helen to think of how the approach to sites navigation would be for an average user. Helen is a new parent that needs rest at home but is worried because she and her partner can't afford to miss hours at work. The DOL website could give her the needed information to resources like FMLA (The Family and Medical Leave Act) to help resolve the issue of missing work and alleviate Helen of the stress of financial complications.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="content_img">

<div>
  <p>
    Keeping in mind how Helen would interact with he DOL website to navigation, I performed some user test to learn what people thought of the site, its ease of use, and what issues could come up when navigating for specific information.

<div>
  <p>
    There were a number of complications with navigating the site on desktop and mobile which included the topics page being 
    difficult to find, overwhelming amount of links , unclear pdf locations, uncentred mobile content, narrow mobile placement 
    along with cut content. Form there i conducted some card sorting sessions to get a better understating of how people preferably 
    grouped the sites sections and was able to create a site map from them.

  <div>
    <p>
      After gathering that information and creating my site map i  was able to make sketch out some wireframes 
      that then became a prototype based off what i believed was a more streamlined experience for a user like Helen 
      to better find the information she would need

    <div>
      <p>
        With the style tile I created using the colors from DOL posters and logo along with the thoughts of making things look more approachable with additions of stylized illustrative icons, descriptive section links to make topics easier to find, my redesign prototype was ready.

  <p>
    I believe with my redesign that Helen and other workers like her looking for information would find this version of the site easier to navigate and have a much more convenient time finding information with how they are grouped and organized. The mobile version i particular has no issues of clipping with easily legible content. 
This was a great way to understand the plight of workers and how the DOL is readily available to help them. With future iteration si would like to flesh out the forms page as it was hard to digest with the amount of links on one page. I believe there could be a way to make it more user friendly .
